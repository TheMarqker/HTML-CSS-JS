<p>HTML uses tags to identify page content. <i>This text, for example is a <em>paragraph </em></i></p>

<h3>Page content</h3>
This main page content appears inside the body tag. 
HTML contains several elements that allow you to poperly structure and format your content, 
which we cover later.

<h3>Content models</h3>
In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block and inline level elements. 
Block level elements would stack on top of each other in normal document flow while inline 
level elements typically appear within the flow of text content.
In this example the heading 1 and the paragraphs are block level items, while the bold tags 
and the link below are examples of inline level elements.
In HTML5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML.
There are seven main models: Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning.

contained in the W3C HTML5 specfication.

<h2>HTML Essential Training</h2>

<h3>Formatting page content</h3>

In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to format basic page content.

<h3>Adding headings</h3>

Headings help define the structure of the page and control the hierarchy of the content. 
You can use heading values ranging from a top-level heading of h1 all the way down to an h6. 
While there are several competing theories on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings, 
what really matters is that you are using them in an intelligent  manner, to accurately reflect the importance of your content.
 It's also important to be consistent in how you use headings across your site, so deciding on when and how to use headings is 
 an important part of planning your site.

 <h3>Using paragraphs</h3>

<p>The paragraph tag (&lang;p&rang;) is one of the most basic formatting tags, and one that you'll use often. 
It indicates a paragraph of text, and should be used for each individual paragraph.</p>

<h3>Line breaks</h3>
<br>Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return," that is, create a new line without using a new paragraph. 
To do that in HTML, you use the line break tag (&lang;br&rang;). Line break tags are inline, meaning you can 
use them within headers and paragraphs, and don't require a closing tag.
Let's say you were formatting an address, for example. You could use line breaks to make sure each line of the
 address appeared on a separate line, but still remained within the same paragraph.
